Jamaker
============

Jamaker is a fixtures replacement with a straightforward definition syntax, support for multiple build strategies (saved instances, unsaved instances, attribute hashes, and stubbed objects), and support for multiple factories for the same class (user, admin_user, and so on), including factory inheritance.

It is heavily influenced by thoughtbot/factory_girl and implements most of their interface.

Jelly
-----

Jamaker is lightly coupled with Jelly. Will add integration with other ORMs in the future.
